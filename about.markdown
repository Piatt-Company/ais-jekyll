AIS is building the premier quality dedicated operations and maintenance partner for the AI infrastructure era — running the power, cooling, and plant systems for hyperscale campuses in Texas and New Mexico.

## Why AIS Exists

AI data centers do not behave like yesterday’s air‑cooled, general‑purpose facilities. Rack densities pushing past 100 kW, complex liquid cooling loops, and cabinets filled with millions of dollars of GPUs have made “smart hands” models and generic facility outsourcing unsafe and inefficient.

AIS was created to close this gap. Our focus is the physical layer of AI infrastructure: power, cooling, and in‑facility hardware logistics from the utility and on‑site generation demarcation point through white space and rack‑level infrastructure. We exist so Campus Directors and VPs of Data Center Operations can rely on a single O&M team that understands both hyperscale AI and industrial trades.

## How AIS Operates

AIS is built on the service‑profit‑chain idea that highly engaged, empowered teams deliver better outcomes for customers. Each customer has a dedicated AIS account team with real authority to solve problems, improve processes, and coordinate across every handoff point on site.

Every account is led by a pair. The Facility Account Manager is responsible for the business relationship, people leadership, and day‑to‑day coordination with your internal stakeholders and vendors. The Critical Facilities Manager is the technical lead who owns the quality of maintenance, change work, and incident response across power, cooling, and related systems. Together they ensure that operations are not just performed, but continuously improved.

## Where We Focus

AIS is intentionally focused on Texas and New Mexico for the first phase of growth. These regions are home to some of the world’s most ambitious AI campuses and offer a unique combination of grid, land, and workforce advantages.

We partner with hyperscale operators, colocation owners, and enterprise AI labs that want to keep in‑cabinet operations as a core competency while trusting an expert O&M partner with everything from the demarcation point to the rack. Our goal is to become the most trusted AI infrastructure O&M team in the Southwest before expanding anywhere else.
