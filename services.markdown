AIS operates the critical power, cooling, and hardware logistics that keep hyperscale AI data centers running in Texas and New Mexico. We take ownership from the utility and on-site generation demarcation point through white space, rack power distribution, and liquid-cooled infrastructure, so your teams can stay focused on GPUs and models instead of mechanical and electrical risk.

Our services are organized into three integrated capabilities that can be delivered together for a 100MW+ campus or tailored to smaller, high‑value AI sites.

## Critical Power Operations

AIS runs the full power path inside the facility—from the automatic transfer switch through switchgear, UPS systems, distribution panels, and busway into rack PDUs. Our teams handle routine operations, preventive maintenance, and change work such as tap‑offs, load balancing, and high‑density cabling so your AI capacity can grow without compromising safety or uptime.

Every site is staffed with trades‑focused professionals who are trained on high‑energy electrical work and coordinated with your internal standards, incident processes, and vendor ecosystem. For 100MW‑class campuses this typically means a 24/7 on‑site presence; for smaller deployments we design response SLAs around your business criticality.

## Liquid Cooling Operations

AIS operates the liquid cooling infrastructure that enables modern AI rack densities, including the pumps, manifolds, and control systems that sit between your facility plant and liquid‑cooled racks. Our teams commission, monitor, and maintain secondary loops, CDUs, and other mainstream architectures such as direct‑to‑chip and rear‑door solutions, working within your vendor ecosystem and reliability targets.

When sensors flag anomalies—temperature excursions, pressure drift, leak alerts—we are the on‑site first responders who investigate, stabilize, and coordinate with your internal and OEM teams. The goal is simple: protect hardware, preserve uptime, and return the environment to a known‑good state as quickly and safely as possible.

## AI Hardware Logistics & Chain‑of‑Custody

AIS manages the physical lifecycle of high‑value AI hardware inside the data center: intake, secure storage, movement to and from racks, and removal of failed components. Each move is tied to an operations ticket, linked with your CMDB, and coordinated with site security so there is a clear, auditable chain‑of‑custody from loading dock to cabinet and back again.

In‑cabinet hardware deployments and de-installs are performed by background‑checked trades professionals who are comfortable working around high‑voltage, liquid‑cooled environments. This reduces risk around multi‑million‑dollar racks, shortens the time from delivery to production, and gives Campus Directors and VPs of Data Center Operations confidence that every asset is where it should be.

We work with each operator to align scope, staffing model, and escalation paths to your specific campus design and internal standards. To discuss how these capabilities apply to your environment, reach out for a site assessment.
