AIS provides specialized operational support for high-density compute environments. We bridge the gap between facility management and IT operations.

## In-Scope Capabilities

We focus on the physical layer of AI infrastructure.

### 1. AI Hardware Logistics
High-value GPU assets require strict chain-of-custody and specialized handling.
* **Secure Receiving:** Validated intake processes for H100/Blackwell class server racks.
* **Racking & Stacking:** Precision installation using server lifts for high-weight chassis.
* **Asset Tagging:** RFID and barcode inventory management integrated with your CMDB.

### 2. Advanced Cooling Operations
AI workloads demand liquid cooling expertise that standard smart-hands lack.
* **CDU Maintenance:** Regular filter changes and pressure monitoring for Coolant Distribution Units.
* **Leak Detection Response:** 24/7 immediate physical response to leak alarms.
* **Loop Commissioning:** Flushing and filling procedures for secondary loops.

### 3. High-Density Power
* **Busway Tap-Offs:** Installation of high-amperage monitoring taps.
* **Load Balancing:** Phase balancing to ensure rack power efficiency.
* **Cable Management:** Airflow-optimized cabling for rear-door heat exchangers (RDHx).

## Out-Of-Scope
To maintain focus and quality, we do *not* provide:
* **Application Support:** We do not touch the OS, drivers, or AI models.
* **General IT Helpdesk:** No end-user laptop or printer support.
* **Facility MEP:** We operate *inside* the rack; we do not repair the building chillers or generators.
