      <p>
        AIS runs the power, cooling, and critical infrastructure for hyperscale AI data centers in Texas and New Mexico, from the utility handoff through rack-level liquid cooling loops so your teams can stay focused on GPUs and models. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Built by cloud and critical-infrastructure veterans, AIS deploys dedicated 24/7 onsite crews for 100MW+ campuses and SLA-based coverage for smaller AI sites across the region.
